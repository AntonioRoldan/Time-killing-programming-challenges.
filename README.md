Solutions to random problemes I find on the internet. 

1. Google interview sample question 

   Given an array A and a number N, tell whether not there's a matching pair of numbers within A whose sum gives us N. 


2. Make bricks

   We want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long. We have a number of small bricks (1 inch each) and big bricks
   (5 inches each). Return True if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks.
   This is a little harder than it looks and can be done WITHOUT loops. 
   
   make_bricks(3, 1, 8) = True
   
   make_bricks(3, 1, 9) = False
   
   make_bricks(3, 2, 10) = True
   
   
3. Amazon interview question
   
   A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as        rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.
   They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that          intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook      or Obama or something.
   
   Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.
   As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is 
   parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.
